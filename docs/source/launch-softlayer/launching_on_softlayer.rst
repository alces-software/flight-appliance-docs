Alces Flight Compute Solo can be launched on the IBM SoftLayer cloud service to give you access to your own, private HPC cluster using configurable infrastructure. Users and administrators have the opportunity to configure their cluster to include whatever resources they need, purchased directly from IBM via a convenient web-interface. Single-user Flight Solo clusters can be launched using your SoftLayer resources by following the documentation referenced below. For more information about running a persistent, multi-user HPC cluster on IBM SoftLayer, please contact the Alces Flight sales team to explore the options available.
