Alces Flight Application Manager Appliance
##########################################

The Alces Flight Application Manager appliance allows users to easily manage their applications, libraries and compilers from a single location. The Application Manager can be deployed one or many times to serve one or many compute environments.

The Application Manager appliance includes several key features, including:

*  **Applications on-demand**

The Application Manager appliance includes the Alces Gridware utility, simplifying installation and management of Linux applications, libraries and compilers. With the Application Manager appliance deployed, applications can be installed from any of your available compute environments, and automatically installed onto the Application Manager appliance - making them available to other compute environments instantly.

* **Share applications among all of your environments**

The Application Manager can be deployed once, to share your applications among many compute environments - reducing overall configuration time of each new compute environment you deploy.
