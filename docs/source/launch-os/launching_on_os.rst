Launching on OpenStack
######################

Alces Flight Compute can be launched on your local OpenStack private cloud platform to give you access to your own, private HPC cluster using your on-premise infrastructure.

Prerequisites
=============

 * Alces OpenStack user account
 * Correctly connected to the cluster DMZ network
 * Appropriate resource quota to create the number of compute nodes you choose
 * OpenStack keypair added

How to deploy
=============

 1.  Log in to the OpenStack Horizon interface with your site credentials
 2.  Navigate to the Project -> Orchestration -> Stacks page
 3.  Select the Launch Stack button
 4.  When prompted for the **Template Source**, select URL and enter the following template URL: 

    ``https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alces-software/flight-appliance-support/master/openstack-heat/templates/flight-compute.yaml``

 5.  Click the ``Next`` button to continue

How to answer Heat Stack questions
----------------------------------

 - The **Stack Name** should be entered with a suitable stack name, this is a unique name within the OpenStack environment and also defines your cluster name
 - In the **Creation Timeout** field - a sensible time in minutes should be entered, this stops stack creation after a certain time if the OpenStack environment is too busy to create your resources
 - In the **Password for user** field - enter your OpenStack password for the user you are currently logged in as
 - In the **Cluster admin key** - select your previously created OpenStack key pair, this is used to log in to the cluster administrator account
 - In the **Administrator username** field, enter your chosen administrator username such as ``alces``
 - In the **Flight Compute image** field, select the Flight Compute image you wish to use - we recommend the latest possible version installed on your system
 - Select the compute node type you wish to deploy from the **Compute node instance type** field
 - In the **Number of compute nodes** field, enter the number of compute nodes you wish to initially deploy. Note - sufficient resource quota must be available in order to launch the nodes

Accessing your cluster 
======================

Once your cluster has been launched, the login node will be accessible via SSH. Your login nodeâ€™s access IP address is reported by the OpenStack Heat, along with the username you must use to login with your keypair.

From the ``Overview`` tab of your stack, make a note of the cluster master node public IP address displayed, e.g. ``10.77.0.100``

To access the cluster login node from a Linux or Mac client, use the following command:

    ``ssh -i mypublickey.pub myadminusername@10.77.0.100``

**Where**:
 - ``mypublickey.pub`` is the name of your public SSH key you selected when launching the cluster
 - ``myadminusername`` is the username you entered when launching the cluster
 - ``10.77.0.100`` is the IP address displayed in the Outputs tab of your Heat stack

If you are accessing from a Windows client using the Putty utility, enter the username and IP address of the cluster login node in the "Host Name" box provided:

The first time you connect to your cluster, you will be prompted to accept a new server SSH hostkey. This happens because you've never logged in to your cluster before - it should only happen the first time you login; click **OK** to accept the warning. Once connected to the cluster, you should be logged in to the cluster login node as your user.

Terminating your environment
============================

1.  From the ``Stacks`` page, select your previously created Alces Flight Compute stack - then select ``Delete Stacks``
