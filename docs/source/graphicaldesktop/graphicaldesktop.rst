Graphical desktop access to your login node
###########################################

Your Alces Flight Compute login node can also run graphical desktop sessions to support users who want to run interactive applications across the cluster. The system can support a number of different sessions simultaneously, and allow multiple remote participants to connect to the same session to support training and collaboration activities. 


Launching a desktop session
===========================

All Flight Compute clusters come pre-installed with a Gnome desktop environment which users can start from the command-line as required. Users can launch a new session by using the ``alces session start gnome`` command.
