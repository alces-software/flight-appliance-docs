What is Alces Flight Compute?
=============================

Alces Flight Compute is a software appliance designed to help researchers and scientists build their own high-performance compute cluster quickly and easily. The basic structure provided for users is as follows:
 - One login node, plus a configurable number of compute nodes
 - An Enterprise Linux operating system
 - A shared filesystem, mounted across all nodes
 - A batch job scheduler
 - Access to a library of software applications

Flight is designed to get researchers started with HPC as quickly as possible, providing a pre-configured environment which is ready for work immediately. The cluster you build is personal to you - users have root-access to the environment, and can setup and configure the system to their needs. 

Who is it for?
--------------

Flight is designed for use by end-users - that's the scientists, researchers, engineers and software engineers who actually run compute workloads and process data. This documentation is designed to help these people to get the best out this environment, without needing the assistance of teams of IT professionals. Flight provides tools which enable users to service themselves - it's very configurable, and can be expanded by individual users to deliver a scalable platform for computational workloads. 


What doesn't it do?
-------------------

Flight is not a replacement for your national super-computer centre. An important part of having ultimate power to control your environment is taking responsibility for it. While no one is going to tell you how you should configure your cluster, you need to remember good security practice, and look after both your personal and research data. Flight provides you with a personal, single-user cluster - please use responsibility. 



How much does it cost?
----------------------

Alces Flight Compute is an open-source software appliance and is freely avaliable to users, released under the General Public License (GPL). Please see the included EULA for details.
